<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hey, My name is Gabriel, Up to date, I'm 18 years old. I'm from Venezuela and I'm currently living in Trinidad & Tobago.
I recently started to study programming and web development because I've alwaays been interested about the subject.
I'm also an artist, I've always loved music and looked at it as a way to really express to others how you feel and
what you think about the world, I am part of a rap crew called "Rapsistencia" (which you could translate to "Rapsistence").
We do most of our music in Spanish, so, if you like Spanish music, check us out, you might like our content. (We also compose songs in other genres)
I currently speak Spanish and English and I'm learning Portuguese.</p>
